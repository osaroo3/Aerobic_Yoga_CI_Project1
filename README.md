# AEROBIC YOGA CI PROJECT 1

The idea behind this project, is to introduce aerobics to yoga exercise, to make it even more fun to partake in. This is done by combining some aerobic exercises, and, also changing certain yoga exercises into steps of dance moves with music often playing in the background.
