# AEROBIC YOGA CI PROJECT 1

The idea behind this project, is to introduce aerobics to yoga exercise, to make it even more fun to partake in. This is done by combining some aerobic exercises, and, also changing certain yoga exercises into steps of dance moves with music often playing in the background. This option is for people who want to have fun while exercising.

# Design

The choice of color, background-color, font and font-family where chosen for simplicity and, also for how visually appealing they can be to site users.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Navigation

There are three navigation links in this project, and they are located at the top right side of the users screen. However, for phone screen, because of its size the navigation link has been compessed into an icon (bars), so that, when clicked the users have access to these navigation links. They can be accessed easily, and also there to enable users navigate between the three pages of this website.

### Home Page main photo

A main photo is used in the index page as the hero image. This is done to draw the attention of the site users to what happens in our studio. The goal is to gain their approval of what we do, and, for them to sign up.

## Future Features

- Add videos of our activities.
- Add testimonies of people, who sign up with us, on our website.

# Testing

Testing of the website was done by me. I open the link on different browsers (Chrome and MS Edge) to be certain they where rendered as I expected. Certain html contents where out of position. This was corrected using appropriate CSS styling.

I have checked to confirm that forms cannot be submitted without valid entries.

I have ensured that this project is responsive on all screens.

## Validator Testing

- HTML: No errors or warnings shown when passed via the official W3C validator:

- Lighthouse (Accessibility Audit): The page achieved a great accessibility performance:

NB: Although the above screenshots only shows the results of the home page, no errors were found on the other pages of the site and they also achieved great accessibility performance.

## Unfixed Bugs

I have found that the spacing below some of the text sections of the 'Buddhism & Meditation' page are quite large. I think that due to the way that I have designed the page by using similar classes for the text tiles to reduce on CSS coding, I had not anticipated that where there are larger blocks of text, that these sections needed to be larger for smaller screens.

I do not think that this takes too much away from the design of the website, and I am happy with how it is, but I do plan to spend some more time on website design in the the future, so I can better plan before a project to avoid this.

It is also noted that the 'Performance' measure from the Lighthouse Accessibility Audit was relatively low (63/100). This is something which I am going to look into so I can improve on it for the future.

# Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

  1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  2. From the settings tab, select the 'Pages' tab in the 'Code and Automation' section.
  3. From the source section drop-down menu, select the 'Main' branch.
  4. Once the 'Main' branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits

I have really enjoyed the Code Institute course up till now, and I am looking forward to the next units of the course. I wanted to thank the Slack Community for their support learning the content and my Mentor Martina for her guidance with this project and assurances that creating a website is not as scary as I initially thought.

As a starting point I looked at the Coders Coffee and Love Running projects.

- From the Love Running Project, I took inspiration for the header, hero banner, footer and form.
- From the Coders Coffee Project, I took inspiration from in my 'What we do?' section.
